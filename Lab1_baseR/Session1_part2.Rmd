# Data types in R

Every object in R has a data type

- Numeric (integer or double): any number

- Character: text objects

- Logical: TRUE or FALSE

To check what is the data type of an object, we can use the function **mode()**

```{r,include=T,eval=FALSE}
# let's create different objects and check for their type
type1 <- 2
type2 <- "banana"
type3 <- "5"
type4 <- TRUE

# check the data type of the different objects - example type1
mode(type1)
# Can we multiply type1 and type3?
```

Checking for data types is important, especially when you will work with more complex data structures

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Data structures

The main data structures in R are:

- Vectors 

- Matrices

- Data Frames

There are also many other data structures (like factors and lists) that will not be discussed in this course.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

> **Important note**
>
In this section, we will describe the main data structures used in R and we will show you how to handle and manipulate these structures using **basic R language**. As of today, an amazing set of packages to work and manipulate data structures has been developed, called **tidyverse**. Many codes are written using tidyverse and often ChatGPT and other language models suggest codes using tidyverse. Moreover, the well known package **ggplot** (the reason many of you are here?) is developed inside tidyverse. The way tidyverse handles data structures is different from how we do it with basic R. Still, **knowing basic R is important** (to properly know the language and to understand other people's scripts); therefore we decided to dedicate this session to learn how to handle data structures with basic R, and from tomorrow on we'll move to tidyverse.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


## Vectors

Vectors are one-dimension sequences of data elements of the **same type**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Creating a vector

- To create a vector, we use the function **c()** - combine.
- The elements inside the c() have to be separated by commas.

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# let's create a vector of numbers
my_first_vec <- c(1,3,5,7,9)
mode(my_first_vec)

# for numerical intervals, we can create a vector using the : (colon)
# the interval includes the extremes!
interval_vec <- 1:5
# this is the same as doing
interval_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

# let's create a character vector - each of the character elements has to be included in quotes!
# spaces between commas do not change the meaning
character_vec <- c("lion", "zebra", "elephant")
mode(character_vec)

# what happens if we don't put the quotes?
character_vec2 <- c(lion, zebra, elephant)

# what happens if we create a "mixed" vector?
mixed_vec <- c("lion", TRUE, 1)
mode(mixed_vec)

```


- tip1: to add the quotes you can select the elements and then press the quote key

- tip2: single quotes can also be used, but in R is preferable to use the double quotes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

###  Combining vectors

Different vectors can be combined

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# let's create the vector planets
gas_planets <- c("Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune")
terrestrial_planets <- c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars")
all_planets <- c(terrestrial_planets,gas_planets)

# we can also combine vectors and single elements
really_all_planets <- c(all_planets,"Pluto")

# how many elements are there in the vector all_planets?
length(all_planets)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Vector manipulation

Learning vector manipulation is essential in R because it forms the foundation for handling more complex data structures, such as data frames and matrices, which is crucial for data analysis and visualization.

- We can name vectors - just for you to know but not that useful

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# let's create a vector of RNA counts - a numeric vector
gene_counts <- c(125,36,42,20)

# let's name each element with the type of gene it belongs to - a character vector
gene_types <- c("protein_coding","lncRNA","pseudogene","miRNA")

# let's assign the gene type as names of the vector
names(gene_counts) <- gene_types
gene_counts

# it did not change mode - the names are not part of the vector
mode(gene_counts)
```


- We can **extract elements** from a vector using **their position (index)** inside the vector
- To extract elements in R we use the square brakets **[]** - common to other languages

![](Y:/lalbinati/Rcourse_material_VHIO/images/vectors_indices.png)

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# extract the elements
gene_counts[1]
gene_counts[2:3]
gene_counts[c(2,4)]

# we can extract and reassign if we want
first_element <- gene_counts[1]
```

- We can also reassign a specific vector element or remove it from the vector
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# we realized we made a mistake and eant to change the third element
gene_counts[3] <- 10
# check gene_counts
gene_counts

# now we want to remove the third element
gene_counts <- gene_counts[-3]
```

- **IMPORTANT**: showing in console and reassigning
![](Y:/lalbinati/Rcourse_material_VHIO/images/reassign.png)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### HANDS-ON
1. From the gene_counts vector, extract the first and third element and multiply them.
2. Then, remove the second element and assign to a new object **mod_vec**.
3. On this new vector, extract the first and third element and multiply them. Does the result change?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Numeric vector manipulation based on content

- Manipulating vectors based on indices can be useful, but most of the times we would **manipulate them based on their content** (i.e.select all the elements grater than x, select only the ones equal to y)

![](Y:/lalbinati/Rcourse_material_VHIO/images/operators.png)

- Example: we want to know which elements of a vector are equal to 7 and which are greater
```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# let's create a numeric vector containing the values 3,11,2,7,9
my_vector <- c(3,11,2,7,9)

# which elements are equal to 7?
my_vector == 7

# which elements are greater than 7?
my_vector > 7

```

![](Y:/lalbinati/Rcourse_material_VHIO/images/vectors_conditions.png)

- We can use this conditions to extract elements from a vector

```{r, include=T,eval=FALSE}
# let's extract all the elements that are smaller or equal than 9
# check the condition
my_vector <= 9

# extract the subvector that complied the condition (so extract only the TRUE elements)
my_vector[my_vector<=9]

# instead of using the index of the vector, we use the condition

# assign the output
smaller_9 <- my_vector[my_vector<=9]

```

- Of course, we can combine multiple conditions
```{r, include=T,eval=FALSE}
# extract the elements greater than 3 and smaller than 11
my_vector[my_vector>3 & my_vector<11]
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### HANDS-ON
- Given a vector of people's height
```{r, include=T,eval=FALSE}
height <- c(182,161,158,179,173,191,181,162,173)
```

- Create a vector namesd **tall** with all the people higher than 170.
- Create a vector named **extreme** with all the people higher than 190 or shorter than 160.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Operations with vector
- We can make standard operations with vectors
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# all of our friends from before are wearing 10 cm heels
height + 10
height_w_heels <- height + 10

# ten is added to each element of the vector
# this can be done with all the operations (square root, subtractions etc)
```

- We can make operations between vectors of the same length
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
vec1 <- c(2,5,7,9)
vec2 <- 2:5

vec1*vec2
vec1-vec2
```

- ... and also between vectors of different length (try not to)
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
vec1 <- c(2,5,7,9)
vec2 <- 2:3

vec1*vec2
vec1-vec2
```

- We can compute the most basic summary statistics
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mean(vec1)
median(vec1)
min(vec1)
max(vec1)
summary(vec1) # useful overview
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### HANDS-ON
- Based on our height vector, what is the mean height of the people that are shorter than 180cm? 
- You can do it in two steps, first extracting the people shorter than 180 and then computing the mean.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Comparing vectors
- We can also manipulate vectors based on comparison with other vectors.
- For instance, to extract elements in vec1 that are also present in vec2.

- To do so, we will use a new operator: **%in%**.

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
vec1 <- 6:9
vec2 <- 8:12

# remember that spaces most of the times do not change anything
vec1 %in% vec2
```

- The output is a TRUE/FALSE vector of the size of the first vector

![](Y:/lalbinati/Rcourse_material_VHIO/images/vecinvec.png)
- So, if we want to extract the elements of vec1 present also in vec2, we do
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
vec1[vec1 %in% vec2]
```

- For character vectors, generally it remains the same
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
names_italian <- c("Alba","Andrea","Vincenza","Tiziana")
names_catalan <- c("Julia","Alba","Roser","Andrea")

names_italian[names_italian%in%names_catalan]

```

- We can also subset vectors based on patterns using grep()
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
RNA_type <- c("mRNA","tRNA","DNA","miRNA")
grep(pattern = "RNA",x = RNA_type)

# grep does not give TRUE/FALSE but gives indeces

RNA_type[grep("RNA",RNA_type)]

```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### EXERCISE
1. Create the script exercise1.R and save it in the Rcourse folder
2. Set there the working directory (if not already there: check!)
3. Create a vector of consecutive numbers from 3 to 9 called **consec**
4. How many elements are in the vector (what is its length)?
5. Print in the console the 3rd element of the vector
6. Assign to a new vector (called **index_sub**) the 1st, the 4th and the 7th element of the vector and print in the console
7. Assign to a new vector (called **big**) all the elements greater than 5 and print in the console
8. Check which elements of big are also present in index_sub and print them in the console

```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# 2 - set and get working directory
getwd()
setwd("/Users/lalbinati/Desktop/Rcourse_2024")

# 3 - consecutive vecot
consec <- 3:9

# 4 - check for the length
length(consec)

# 5 - print one element based on index
consec[3]

# 6 - extract and assign multiple elements based on index
index_sub <- consec[c(1,4,7)]

# 7 - extract and assign multiple elements based on value
big <- consec[consec > 5]

# 8 - check for element between vectors
big[big%in%index_sub]
```

  
</details>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Matrices

- Matrices are two-dimensional structures of one data type (numeric, character, logical)
- All the rows have to be the same length, same for the columns
- In R normally is preferable to work with dataframes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Creating a matrix
- It is not something that you will do often, so do not focus on this but just to give you an idea (and to have it here in case you need it)
```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# combining vectors as columns 
vec1 <- c(1,5,7,9)
vec2 <- c(4,2,2,3)
vec3 <- c(1,4,2,7)

matrix1 <- cbind(vec1,vec2,vec3)

# combining vectors as rows
matrix2 <- rbind(vec1,vec2,vec3)

# with the matrix function
matrix3 <- matrix(c(4,0,12,7,11,5),nrow = 3,ncol = 2)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Exploring and manipulating matrices

- While vector were mono dimensional, matrices have two dimensions.
- Working with multi-dimension structures, it is good to explore their size and their first last columns before starting to operate with them.
```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# for the general dimensions
dim(matrix3)

# specific for rows and columns
ncol(matrix3)
nrow(matrix3)

# print the first/last rows - not useful in this case
head(matrix3)
tail(matrix3)
```

- We access these two dimension always with the **[]**, but this time we put a comma in between
- Before the comma, we can give the coordinates of the rows and after the comma the coordinate of the columns

![](Y:/lalbinati/Rcourse_material_VHIO/images/matrix.png)

- We can work on a matrix the same way we were doing on vectors - extracting based on indices

```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# extracting the first row of a matrix
matrix3[1,]

# extracting the second column of a matrix
matrix3[,2]

# extracting the third element of the second column of a matrix
matrix3[3,2]

# calculating the mean of the first column
mean(matrix3[1,])
```

- We can work on a matrix the same that we were doing on vectors - extracting based on values
- For instance, let's say we want to subset the matrix keeping only the rows for which the first column value is above 3

```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# the condition - first column > 3. When is it satisfied?
matrix3[,1]>3

# now let's subset for this condition. Before or after the comma?
matrix3[matrix3[,1]>3,]
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### HANDS-ON
1. From matrix3, calculate the mean of the first column.
2. Subset the matrix3 keeping all the rows that have a value in column 1 equal to 0.
3. Then, subset the matrix3 keeping all the rows that have a value in column 2 above 9 or below 6.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Data frames
- A data frame is a **two-dimensional** element.
- Differently from the matrix, can contain **different data types**.
- Still, each column should be of a specific data type.
- It is generally organized by columns (that are the **variables**) and each row is an **observation** for that variable.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Create a data frame
- Generally we can create a data frame from the scratch or converting other structures (like matrices)
```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# converting matrices
df3 <- as.data.frame(matrix3)

# creating from scratch - the data.frame() function
people <- data.frame(c("Leone","Julia","Luisa"),
                     c(31,30,28),
                     c(T,F,T))

# let's print in the console
people

# let's check for the mode of the different columns
mode(people[,1])
mode(people[,2])
mode(people[,3])

# we can add column names to the dataframe
# column names are really important for dataframes
colnames(people) <- c("name","age","italian")

# we can also add rownames, but being observation these are not really needed
rownames(people) <- c("PhD_student1","PhD_student2","PhD_student3")

# generally, column names are already added when creating the dataframe - without 
#column names a data frame is "meaningless", because we do not knowthe variables 
people <- data.frame(name=c("Leone","Julia","Luisa"),
                     age=c(31,30,28),
                     italian=c(T,F,T))

# we can agan add the rownames - not something we do often
rownames(people) <- c("PhD_student1","PhD_student2","PhD_student3")

```



![](Y:/lalbinati/Rcourse_material_VHIO/images/dataframe.png)

- We can access the elements in the datframe with their **indices** or with their **colnames/rownames**
```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# these two are the same
people[,1]
people[,"name"]

people[2,2]
people["PhD_student2","age"]
```

- **Important**: for data frames, we can retrieve columns using the **dollar symbol**
```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# these two are the same
people[,"name"]
people$name

# we can even create a new column using the dollar symbol
people$beach_volley <- c(F,T,T)
people
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Data frame manipulation
- We manipulate data frame as if they were **vectors but in two dimensions**!
```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# these command all output the same
people[people[,2]>=30,]
people[people[,"age"]>=30,]
people[people$age>=30,] # BEST OPTION! We prefer to use the dollar with data frames

# let's see it line by line to understand what we are doing
# 1. Extract the column with the $ sign
people$age

# 2. check for your condition of interest (i.e. age >= 30)
people$age >= 30

# subset the data frame to select only the rows that fulfill the condition
people[people$age >= 30,]

```

![](Y:/lalbinati/Rcourse_material_VHIO/images/dataframe_subset.png)

- Of course, we can select for multiple criterias
```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# select the people that have more or equal than 30 yo and that are not from Italy
people[people$age >= 30 & people$italian==FALSE,]
# select the people that are less than 30 yo or that paly beachvolley
people[people$age < 30 | people$beach_volley==TRUE,]

```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### Ultra-quick HANDS-ON
- What is the age of the italian beach-volleyball player? No manual counting, let's store the output in an object called **italian_bv_age**

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# select the people that play bv and that are from Italy
italian_bv <- people[people$beach_volley == TRUE & people$italian==TRUE,]
# extract the column with the age and assign
italian_bv_age <- italian_bv$age
```
</details>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Selection based on patterns
- We can also subset dataframes based on patterns
```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# We can add a new column based on where these people are located
people$location <- c("sixth_office6","fourth_office3","fourth_office6")

# How can we select the people that work at the 4th floor
# we can select base on pattern using the grep function
# Let's see it line by line
people$location
grep(pattern = "fourth",x = people$location)
people[grep(pattern = "fourth",x = people$location),]
fourth_floor_people <- people[grep(pattern = "fourth",x = people$location),]
# grep has other interesting arguments, check n the help manual

```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Input and output

## Write tables
We have now produced this new people data frame, and we want to save it. To save files from R to our computer, we can use the function **write.table()**. This functions has some parameters that is better to specify to get the output as we want.

```{r,include=T,eval=FALSE}
# Imagine we want to write an object as tab-separated
write.table(x = people, # object we want to save
            file = "people.txt", # path and name we want to assign + extension
            sep = "\t", # type of separator - in this case is tab
            col.names = T, # do we want to include the column names?
            row.names = F, # do we want to include the column names?
            quote = F) # Do we want to have character elements in quotes?

# ... and as comma-separated
write.table(x = people, # object we want to save
            file = "people.csv", # path and name we want to assign + extension
            sep = ",", # type of separator - in this case is comma
            col.names = T, # do we want to include the column names?
            row.names = F, # do we want to include the column names?
            quote = F) # Do we want to have character elements in quotes?

```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Read tables
Let's pretend now our day is over and we saved our file. We close everything (empty the environment). We start working the next day, and we want to keep working on our people dataset. We can **load** it back in R.

Since now we have worked with dataframes and objects that we were creating in R. However, most of the times you will have to **"load" objects in R** (something produced by previous analysis, published data etc). To load data frames and matrix saved as csv, tsv, txt etc, we can use the **read.table()** function

```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# to load a table, we assign it to an object
people_reload <- read.table(file = "people.txt",
                            header = T)
# what happens if we try to load the .csv without specifying the separator?
people_reload <- read.table(file = "people.csv",
                            header = T)

# if we know the type of file, better to specify the separator
people_reload <- read.table(file = "people.csv",
                            header = T,
                            sep = ",")
```

**Important message**: when we load a dataframe in R and we modify, we are not modifying the version on the computer. To save the changes we are doing we will have to write it again in the computer!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


# Missing values
**NA** (Not Available) is a recognizable element in R.
```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
missing_obj <- NA
missing_obj
mode(missing_obj)

mis_vec <- c(13,9,NA,8)
mode(mis_vec)

# to know which element is an NA we can use the is.na() function
is.na(mis_vec)

# try to remove the missing value from the vector mis_vec. How would you do it?
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


# Summary exercise
- 1. Create the script exercise_data_frame.R and save it in your Rcourse_2024 folder.
- 2. Check your working directory, and if it is not the Rcourse_2024 folder set it there.
- 3. Let's load the dataset we'll work on. R already contains some dataset that you can load. For this exercise we load the **iris** dataset. This dataset contains measurement from three different iris plant species (setosa, virginica, versicolor), measuring width and length of petals and sepals.

```{r,include=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# load the iris dataset - to load it we use the function data()
data(iris)

# let's check the first columns to understand this dataset
head(iris)
```

- 4. Calculate the **mean petal length** in the dataset.
- 5. Create a subset data frame (called **no_setosa**) that does not contain the species **setosa**.
- 6. Now subset the no_setosa dataframe keeping only flowers with a petal length > 4 and a sepal width < 3. Assign the output to an object called **selection**. How many observation are in this data frame?
- 7. How many virginica and versicolor are there in this **selection** dataset? Check the **table()** function.
- 8. Create a vector called **interesting**, storing there the two character elements "setosa" and "virginica".
- 9. Now subset the iris dataframe, selecting only the rows for which the column **Species** is found in the interesting vector.
- 10. Save the iris dataframe to a file called iris.txt. Do it in a tab separated format, keeping the column names but not the rownames.In which folder is this file automatically saved?

```{r,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# 2. Check and change working directory
getwd()
setwd("your/path/to/working/directory")

# 4. Calculate mean of petal length
mean(iris$Petal.Length)

# 5. Data frame without setosa
no_setosa <- iris[iris$Species!="setosa",]
nrow(no_setosa) # to know the n of observations

# 6. Select for multiple conditions
selection <- no_setosa[no_setosa$Petal.Length>4&no_setosa$Sepal.Width<3,]

# 7. Counting observation in one column
table(selection$Species)
# other solution might be to subset the dataframe for our condition and count
nrow(selection[selection$Species=="virginica",])
nrow(selection[selection$Species=="versicolor",])

# 8. Create a new vector
interesting <- c("setosa","virginica")

# 9. Subset iris for common elements with the interesting vectors
subset <- iris[iris$Species%in%interesting,]

# 10. Save the iris datase
write.table(x = iris,file = "iris.txt",col.names = T,row.names = F,quote = F,sep = "\t")
